===================================================
This is the application for communicating with the
server running on the phone to get the touch coordinates 
and move the mouse accordingly.

This is primarily meant for communicating over
USB via ADB Port forwarding that is why it is
only client and not the server.

Before executing
adb forward tcp:10911 tcp:10911
and start the server on the Android phone for this 
client to communicate

It is programmed to communicate over port no 10911
